# **Hana Rae**

Welcome! I am a second year master's student at the University of Wyoming Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics. I'm interested, broadly speaking, in the intersection of agriculture and conservation - in how resources are valued and allocations are made - and I love cross-disciplinary research! I've built this website to add projects and resources as I go, and if you find something interesting please don't hesitate to reach out! You can find my contact information on my bio page, connect with me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hana-fancher001), or on [github](https://github.com/hfancher).
